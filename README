Project description:
  Added player mechanics, collisions, AI, and a HUD. I want to use the same framework and physics,
  but change the sprites in my game to create a racing type game. I want to build the sprites on my
  own, but haven't had the time yet so I am keeping the same sprites from before. My idea is to have
  a fixed length world, and you want to get to the end as fast as possible. In the way are other cars
  that you have to tailgate behind and cops that can pull you over (add time). Score would be kept in
  the form of time and the game would conclude when the car gets to the end of the level.
The easiest part of this project:
  The easiest part of this project was implementing the player class because we could mostly use your code.

Problems that I had in completing this project:
  The hardest part of this project was definitely creating the HUD class, as we had to create our own class
  from scratch. That being said, it was also by far the most rewarding when we finished the HUD class,
  because you know that you created the HUD class completely without using anyone else's code.
